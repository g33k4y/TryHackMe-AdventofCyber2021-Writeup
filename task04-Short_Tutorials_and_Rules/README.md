# Introduction

To access target machines you deploy on TryHackMe will need to either, use an OpenVPN client, or deploy your own web-based AttackBox (you can do this by clicking the blue "Start AttackBox" button at the top of this page). We highly recommend you complete the [Tutorial](https://tryhackme.com/room/tutorial) room to learn more about getting connected.

Using the web-based AttackBox, you can complete all of these exercises through your browser. If you're a regular user, you can deploy the AttackBox for free 1 hour a day, if you're [subscribed](https://tryhackme.com/profile#subscribe) you can deploy it for an unlimited amount of time!
